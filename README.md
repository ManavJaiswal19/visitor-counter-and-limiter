The project is made on the tinkercad platform.
Abstract- The system counts both the entering and exiting visitor of the auditorium or hall. Depending upon the sensors interruption, the system identifies the entry and exit of the visitor. On the successful setting of thelimit, it displays the number of visitor present in the auditorium or hall and warns when the limit is reached.
The system constantly checks the number of persons in the room and compares it with the limit set in the beginning. Actions like controling electrical appliances are taken based on the number of people and the limit. This is an economical cost reducing system which can be implemented in places where the visitors have to be counted and controlled.
